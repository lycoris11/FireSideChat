# FireSideChat
Messaging/Chatroom Web App Client

## Built On 
jQuery, JS, HTML, and CSS were used to create this app.

Servers side handling was done by Firebase. I do not own, and am not affiliated with Firebase, and did not create it.
Data was stored & synced on Firebase's NoSQL cloud database. Data is stored as JSON, synced to all connected clients in realtime, and available even if my app goes offline.

## Running
Just smash that mf index.html file and open it in the browser of your choice.

## Contributing
